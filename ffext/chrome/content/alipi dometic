The minimum wages Act was introduced in 1948. It concerns the Domestic workers. The Act prescribes the benifits that the domestic workers are eligible for. Such as 

1:maximum number of working hours.
2:Extra payemnt over overtime
3:One day off for every seven days of work. 

The act's main object is to prevent sweated labour. As its meant for domestic labour, we cant expect them to know english or expect them to understand the technical words involved. Hence using this tool, we can re-narrate in a way that the workers can understand.
